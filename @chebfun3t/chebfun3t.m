classdef chebfun3t
%CHEBFUN3T   CHEBFUN3T class for representing functions on [a,b]x[c,d]x[e,g].
% 
%   Class for approximating smooth functions defined on finite boxes using 
%   the vanilla flavoured full tensor product approach. The output contains 
%   a tensor of coefficients of the Chebyshev expansion of the input function.
%
%   CHEBFUN3T(F) constructs a CHEBFUN3T object representing the function F on
%   [-1,1]x[-1 1]x[-1 1]. F should be a function handle, e.g.,
%   @(x,y,z) x.*y + cos(x).*z. F should in be "vectorized" in 
%   the sense that it may be evaluated at a tensor of points and returns a 
%   tensor output. 
%
%   CHEBFUN3T(F, 'eps', ep) specifies chebfun3eps to be epsVal.
%
%   CHEBFUN3T(F, [A B C D E G]) specifies a cube [A B]x[C D]x[E G] where the 
%   function is defined. A, B, C, D, E and G must all be finite.
%
%   Examples: 
%   f = @(x,y,z) 1./(1 + x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2);
%   f3t = chebfun3t(f);
%   f3t = chebfun3t(f, [-2 2 1 2 1 3]);
%   f3t = chebfun3t(f,'eps', 1e-10);
%   f3t = chebfun3t(f,[-2 2 1 2 1 3],'eps', 1e-10);
